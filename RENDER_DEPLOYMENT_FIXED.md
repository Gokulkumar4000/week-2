# âœ… FIXED: Render Deployment Instructions

## ðŸ”§ Issue Resolved
The vite import error has been completely fixed by creating a production-only entry point (`server/index.production.ts`) that has zero frontend dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Render - Use These EXACT Settings

### Step 1: In Render Dashboard
1. Go to your service settings
2. **Update Build Command** to this exact command:

```bash
npm install --production && npx esbuild server/index.production.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Set these in Render:
```
NODE_ENV=production
```

Optional for Google Sheets:
```
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY=your_json_key_here
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=your_sheet_id_here
```

### Step 3: Start Command
**IMPORTANT**: Change the start command to:
```bash
node dist/index.production.js
```

### Step 4: Deploy
Click "Manual Deploy" to trigger a new deployment with the fixed build command.

## âœ… What's Fixed
- **No more vite imports**: Production entry point is completely separate
- **Backend-only dependencies**: Only installs what's needed for the API
- **Clean build process**: Tested and verified to work
- **All features preserved**: Customer feedback, Google Sheets, dashboard APIs

## ðŸ§ª Test After Deployment
Your endpoints will be:
- Health: `https://your-service.onrender.com/health`
- API Root: `https://your-service.onrender.com/`
- Reviews: `https://your-service.onrender.com/api/reviews`
- Stats: `https://your-service.onrender.com/api/reviews/stats`

## ðŸ“Š Customer Feedback System Ready
Once deployed, your complete system will work:
1. Customer submits feedback via your Netlify form
2. Data saves to Render backend + Google Sheets backup
3. Admin dashboard shows real-time charts and analytics

The build has been tested locally and works perfectly. Use the exact build command above and your deployment will succeed!
