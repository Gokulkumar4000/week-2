# ðŸ”§ Google Sheets Integration - Quick Fix

## Issue
Your Render backend is working perfectly, but Google Sheets isn't receiving data because the authentication isn't set up.

## Your Sheet
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WKYfPumkpy42J0ATDU5mF76uvU8MQGJwRMXDu1e_fnQ/edit

## Quick Setup (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Create Google Service Account
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Create new project or select existing
3. Enable Google Sheets API:
   - Click "APIs & Services" â†’ "Library"
   - Search "Google Sheets API" â†’ Click "Enable"

### Step 2: Create Credentials
1. Go to "APIs & Services" â†’ "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" â†’ "Service Account"
3. Name: `feedbackpro-service`
4. Click "Create and Continue" â†’ Skip roles â†’ "Done"
5. Click on the service account you just created
6. Go to "Keys" tab â†’ "Add Key" â†’ "Create new key" â†’ "JSON"
7. Download the JSON file

### Step 3: Share Your Sheet (CRITICAL)
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Click "Share" button (top right)
3. In the JSON file you downloaded, find `"client_email"` field
4. Copy that email address (looks like: `feedbackpro-service@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
5. Add this email to your sheet with "Editor" permissions
6. Click "Send"

### Step 4: Set Render Environment Variables
Go to your Render service â†’ Environment and add:

**GOOGLE_SHEET_ID:**
```
1WKYfPumkpy42J0ATDU5mF76uvU8MQGJwRMXDu1e_fnQ
```

**GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY:**
Copy the entire content of your downloaded JSON file as a single line. Example:
```json
{"type":"service_account","project_id":"your-project-123","private_key_id":"abc123","private_key":"-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nYOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n","client_email":"feedbackpro-service@your-project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com","client_id":"123456789","auth_uri":"https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth","token_uri":"https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token","auth_provider_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs","client_x509_cert_url":"https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs/feedbackpro-service%40your-project-123.iam.gserviceaccount.com"}
```

### Step 5: Prepare Sheet Headers
In your Google Sheet, add these headers in Row 1:
- A1: `Timestamp`
- B1: `Rating`
- C1: `Sentiment` 
- D1: `Comment`
- E1: `Email`

## Test the Integration
1. After setting environment variables, redeploy your Render service
2. Submit a test review through your Netlify form
3. Check your Google Sheet - new data should appear automatically

## Verify It's Working
- Check Render logs for any Google Sheets errors
- Submit test review via your frontend
- Confirm data appears in both API (`/api/reviews`) and Google Sheet

The most common issue is forgetting to share the sheet with the service account email - make sure you complete Step 3!
